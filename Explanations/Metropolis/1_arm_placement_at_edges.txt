Given that all arms are parallel to (0,1,0) (up on dx),
the placement is a problem in two dimensions, the xz
plane.

In [1] we see where we place the arms, if the edge
has length l, then p is valid if 
VertexDistance < p < l - VertexDistance

In [2] we see that topological nearness can't be used
to check for spatial distance. So we can't rule out
farther edges in the graph when looking for collisions.
In that case e0 and e1 intersect even if they are far
in the graph.

[3] We'll assume the edges to be linear, and make enough
distance so that they don't touch.
