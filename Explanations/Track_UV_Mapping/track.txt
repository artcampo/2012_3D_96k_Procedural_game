The integral of the length along the path and slice can
be computed as uv coord. The path can be tiled, but the
slices goes from 0 to N, and it should be fitted to
[0, N/2] and [N/2,0] so it tiles itself. If the point
N/2 is in either side, the surface where the ball
slides won't have any mirroring.
